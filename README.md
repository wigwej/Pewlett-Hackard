# Pewlett-Hackard

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Based on the previous analysis of data of employees at Pewlett Hackard, Bobby has been tasked with analysing the data to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify the employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. The analysis should help Bobby's manager prepare for 'silver tsunami' as the current employees attain retirement.

**RESULTS**

* About 98% of current employees fall within the retirement bracket.

* Only 1550 employees are eligible for mentorship program

* Most of the employees elibible for mentorship occupy senior positions.

* Pewlett Hackard is top heavy.


**SUMMARY**
Roles to be filled: the retiring titles table and the Unique titles table provide a list of titles of employees fue for retirement. Over twenty four thousand were senior staff, over seven thousand are Engineers and three thousand six hundred and one are technical leaders. Of the current staff, there appears to be sufficient staff to cover for the roles of the retiring staff in event of a silver tsunami.

The quantum of technical leaders, engineers and senior staff balance out.  Commensurate with the number of employees left after retriement,  there appears to be enough qualified mentors left over.
